        <td>Overview</td>
        <td>Apricots is a game I've been writing in my spare time.
        Despite the name, it has nothing to do with apricots.
        It's a game where you fly a little plane around the
        screen and shoot things and drop bombs on enemy targets,
        and it's meant to be quick and fun.</td>

        <td>History</td>
        <td>The original version of the game dates back to around
        1991. The very first version of the game was written on
        an Amiga, using the AMOS language, and the game was
        called 'Planegame'. This was a very simple affair with
        simplistic landscapes, no guns or shrapnel, and very
        limited computer AI. It was also dreadfully slow. The
        AMOS compiler improved things somewhat at a later date. A
        couple of years later I obtained the BLITZ language for
        the Amiga, and ported 'Planegame' carefully over to that,
        resulting in a huge speedup. Impressed by the capabilites
        of BLITZ, in 1995 I proceeded to rewrite the game
        entirely from scratch, even using completely new graphics
        and sound. The result was 'Planegame2', which, for
        various reasons also got dubbed 'Apricots'. This new
        version of the game added anti-aircraft guns, shrapnel,
        trees, towers, water, better airbases and a huge
        improvement on graphics, sound, and intelligent computer
        AI. Slightly later, in 1996, the Draks were added as a
        bit of amusement. The result was a highly playable game,
        which I distributed to a few of my friends. A few years
        later and I now use a PC, which can run Linux. Having
        learnt C++ by this time, at the beginning of 2002 I felt
        ready enough to port 'Apricots' cross platform from BLITZ
        on the Amiga to C++ on a Linux PC. What you see here is
        work in progress on that port. The game has been tweaked
        slightly while being ported over, so is not identical to
        the Amiga version.</td>

        Gameplay is fairly common sense to work out.
        Stay alive, and shooting enemy targets gains you points,
        whereas being shot down or shooting the wrong things lose
        you points. You have infinite planes, and are competing
        against the other computer planes (or other player!).
        First to a certain score wins once they land at base.
        Simple!</td>

            fixes the problem. But I shouldn't need to use arts.</i></li>
        <li>BUG3 - Multiple monitors causes SDL_FULLSCREEN to do odd things
            (reported by Nathan Fritz).<br><i>Status: Unconfirmed. Possibly a desktop
            configuration setting?</i></li>
        <li>BUG4 - On my box, the Linux version runs about 3 times slower than
            the Windows version (reported by Mark Snellgrove). <br><i>Status: Uncertain. This
            is in fact very unlikely to be a bug in apricots, as the same code and same hardware
            are used. I'm just mentioning it here to see if anyone else has similar problems, or if
            it's just a Linux graphics driver problem on my box (I'm using a Sis305 on RedHat 9).</i></li>
